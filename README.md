<img src="./assets/img/greet.gif" width="25"> Hey there, it's Shivam Shandilya, a self-proclaimed Vyomanaut. I'm an undergrad who's obsessed with all things tech, especially `Linux` and when I'm not tinkering with my linux installation(I use arch btw), you'll find me forging some `data science` and `web dev` projects.

I'm also passionate about `open source` projects. I believe in making a positive impact, even if it means stumbling through lines of code like a clumsy penguin on ice <img src="./assets/img/penguin-bowing.gif" width="40">

So, if you're up for some tech experiments, or just a good laugh just hit me up!
